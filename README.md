# Taxonomy Files for InstructLab Demos

This repository contains taxonomy files that will be used for our InstructLab and RHEL AI demonstrations. These files serve as the foundation for building specialized language models tailored to our demo requirements.

## Purpose

1. Store and version control our taxonomy files
2. Provide a centralized location for collaboration on taxonomy development
3. Serve as a source for our model building pipeline

## Build Process

Our models will be built using the following specifications:

- **Build Environment:** Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) AI
- **Output Formats:**
  - SafeTensors
  - GGUF (GPT-Generated Unified Format)
